We have a different search page implementatation that
is currently located in the old files folder - we are
going to try to combine the two at some point as they
both have their benefits.

Admin username is admin1 - admin pw is admin2

Got the admin page to only appear on link's click when
admin1 is logged in, otherwise it sends a request refused
page

Got the admin's creation of Customer Rep accounts to 
work properly

Changed the schema around a bit to add a few new tables
and fields

currently working on customer support & the rest of 
adminfunctiionality
